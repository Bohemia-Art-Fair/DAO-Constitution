## **WHY BOHEMIA?**

The crypto community will always remember 2021 as the year when NFTs became mainstream. Accordingly, NFTs have kickstarted a revolution and democratized the art world.

NFTs offer a platform for all artists, regardless of their circumstances or origins, to monetize their work. On the other hand, collecting art has become much more accessible for collectors, who now have access to numerous art collections, no matter where and by whom they were created.

The aim of this project is to bring art collectors, artists, and the NFT community more broadly together and enable people to showcase their NFT artworks in an innovative way.

### **WHAT ARE NFTS?**

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets (e.g., artworks, music, gifs, videos, etc.) that are linked to the blockchain. These tokens function as proof of ownership of the underlying digital asset.

### **WHAT IS THE METAVERSE?**

The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment in which people from all over the world can come together to connect in an interactive way.

### **WHY SOLANA?**

Bohemia has chosen the Solana blockchain because of its performance, low gas fees, and tight-knit community. The Solana community reflects how we envision the Bohemian community; nevertheless, we’ll welcome Ethereum holders with open arms in Bohemia.

## **BOHEMIAN ART FAIR**

With so many artists having passionately created NFT artworks during the past year, it is time to unite them and allow the world to experience this new age of art in a way like never before.

Our mission is to create an interactive NFT Art Fair on the Solana blockchain, housing interactive galleries with 5,000 Bohemians. The art fair will welcome art collectors holding both Solana and Ethereum NFTs, so all of these beautiful pieces of art will be united in one place.

The Galleries of Bohemia will continuously evolve and become more interactive and advanced each step of the way.

### **BOHEMIAN NFTS**

The Bohemian NFT collection is created by renowned Filipino artist @gringograss. Creating art is his passion, and he is grateful to be able to turn his passion into his work. He primarily focuses on making ink paintings on paper; however, he is not afraid to create murals and large-format paintings as well.

Gringo has hand-drawn over 170 custom traits, giving each Bohemian its own unique characteristics. Although they are all different, they all share the same deep connection for creativity, self-expression, and community.

The collection has a well-developed rarity system that can be accessed on the website. Each Bohemian NFT is a masterpiece that will function as a PFP NFT of which holders can be proud. Holding a Bohemian NFT functions as proof of membership in the Galleries of Bohemia.

### ![](.gitbook/assets/6)**HARMONY - Q3 2022**

Bohemia wants to offer the best of both worlds. All beautiful artworks residing on the Ethereum blockchain should evidently also be on display in the Galleries of Bohemia.

With Harmony, Metamask Ethereum integrations are enabled, offering galleries the opportunity to create exhibits with both Solana and Ethereum NFTs. This allows exhibits to be more complete and in harmony with the NFT metaverse.

The general public can now enter Bohemia and visit the exhibitions in the Galleries of Bohemia. It will be possible to lease a gallery in Bohemia as a non-holder by paying $WOOP.

### ![](.gitbook/assets/7)**OPUS - Q3 2022**

Opus enables visitors to purchase NFTs displayed in ex hibitions if they have been listed by the Bohemian holder.

The Curators of Bohemia will conclude partnerships with secondary marketplaces for this. If someone is interested in purchasing, they are then connected from the Bohemi an Gallery to the secondary marketplace.

### ![](.gitbook/assets/8)**EUPHORIA - Q4 2022**

Euphoria heralds the introduction of the new Bohemian NFT collection: the female companions of the Bohemians. The benefits of holding both male and female Bohemians are described in the utility section.

### ![](.gitbook/assets/9)**RENAISSANCE - Q1 2023**

The Bohemian Renaissance will be the rebirth of Bohemia in a fully virtual world. Bohemians will be able to roam around Bohemia with their avatars, visit galleries, and complete fun side activities. During the Renaissance phase, in addition to leasing, it will be possible to purchase Bohemian Galleries.

The curators will involve the BohemianDAO in the creation of this new virtual world, which will offer endless possibilities.

Holders can participate in creating exhibitions and access the state-of-the-art Bohemian Galleries, developed with Unreal Engine 5. There are various types of galleries with different capacities enabling communities, DAOs, groups, and individuals to experience the art fair in their preferred way.

### **UTILITY COIN - $WOOP**

Bohemia’s utility coin is $WOOP, which can be earned by participating in the Bohemian Art Fair. Bohemians will be able to earn $WOOP in following ways:

Staking your NFT in the Bohemian HQ.

Participating and displaying NFTs in a gallery.

As rewards for high-ranked galleries.

Bohemians will be able to spend $WOOP in the followings ways: Decorating and upgrading galleries.

Holders will have priority to obtain a Bohemian Mint Pass for the Euphoria collection. The collection will offer female companionship to our Bohemians. Holding both male and female Bohemians will produce the following perks:

Staking them together will earn the holder more $WOOP.

### **REAL-WORLD UTILITIES**

Real-world NFT exhibitions will be held from time to time, during which top-ranked galleries will be able to show off their collections. Bohemia’s Curators will rent out a gallery, place digital screens, and display Bohemia’s best exhibition. These will be held simultaneously with Solana Conferences. Additionally, holders will be able to purchase limited-edition Bohemia merch using $WOOP.

## **TOKENOMICS**

### **$WOOP IS PRODUCED BY STAKING & VOTING**

The initial supply of $WOOP will be 0, as it will only be possible to create $WOOP through **staking** and **voting**.

Bohemia has multiple burning mechanisms / utilites in place to reduce the circulating supply, this will ensure that $WOOP is a wanted coin and its value increases.

We expect that approximately **2.7 million $WOOP** will be created every month by **staking** and an additional **800.000 $WOOP** will be given each month as a reward for **voting** on other gallery exhibits. The **total supply** created **each month** will be arround **3,5 million $WOOP**.

## **TECHNOLOGIES**

### **UNREAL ENGINE 5**

We have chosen Unreal Engine 5 to create our 3D environment because it is a game changer and will become the standard for real-time content experiences. One of the new features of Unreal Engine 5 for which we are most excited is Nanite.

Nanite offers a virtualized micropolygon geometry system that makes it possible to create film-quality environments in a performant way. With UE5, we will be able to make our world incredibly detailed, enabling Bohemians to have an astonishing experience.

UE5 will provide the scalability to let Bohemia grow and become a fully-fledged virtual world—or metaverse, as we call it. Besides creating our virtual world, UE5 will be an important tool for creating our Bohemian avatars and implementing gamification.

### **UNREAL ENGINE PIXEL STREAMING**

Bohemia has chosen to work with Unreal Engine Pixel Streaming because it is important that galleries are accessible for our holders. Everyone with access to a modern web browser will be able to visit the galleries with their art exhibitions.

We will deploy our UE application on a high-performance cloud server along with a handful of web services that are included with Unreal Engine. You will be able to visit the galleries using any modern web browser and stream the rendered frames from the Unreal Engine application. There is no need for users to install or download anything—it is just like streaming a video from YouTube or Netflix.

### **CROSS CHAIN COMPATIBILITY**

As of the Harmony phase, it will be possible to add both Solana and Ethereum NFTs to exhibitions. The Gallery Dashboard will provide the option to connect with Ethereum-based wallets, such as Metamask.

## **THE GALLERIES**

The first Bohemian Galleries will open 8-10 weeks after the mint has been completed. Bohemia will add new galleries on a regular basis, thus enabling an increasing number of Bohemians to participate in the galleries. We will provide regular community updates concerning the development progress we are making.

The Gallery Section on the website will display an overview of the Bohemian Galleries. When accessing one of the galleries, the 3D environment will be displayed, which will immerse the viewer in the Bohemian world.

### **GALLERY DASHBOARD**

The Gallery Dashboard application is a web based application made in React and is available for staked members of the gallery. The dashboard will enable members to configure their gallery exhibitions and adjust general gallery settings.

Add and remove NFTs from the exhibit

Open the exhibit for non-gallery members

### **STAKING**

Decorating and upgrading galleries. Additional outdoor settings.

The Gallery section on the website will offer holders the possibility to connect their wallet holding their Bohemians NFTs. When connected, an overview of the Bohemians held will be displayed. Staking in HQ will become available already a few weeks after mint so everyone can start earning $WOOP.

When staking in a new gallery, the holder will be able to enter the gallery and obtain access to the GalleryDAO after 24 hours. This time-lock is implemented to prevent Bohemians from continuously switching between galleries.

People who own multiple Bohemian NFTs can decide to stake in HQ, different galleries, or stake all of them in one gallery.

### **CURATING**

Through the Gallery Dashboard, members can configure the exhibition using their NFTs. Each gallery can display a maximum of 50 NFTs, regardless of its type or capacity. If an NFT used in an exhibit is removed from the wallet by selling or transferring, it will also be removed from the gallery.

Each GalleryDAO elects its own Gallery Curator, who is responsible for providing guidance to the gallery and overseeing the quality of the exhibit being created. Furthermore, the Gallery Curator has the ability to remove NFTs from the exhibit.

### **TYPES OF GALLERIES**

#### **PUBLIC GALLERIES**

Public galleries are accessible to all Bohemians, and everyone can decide to stake their Bohemians there as long the maximum capacity has not been reached. Public galleries come with following capacities:

Maximum capacity of 3 Bohemians

Maximum capacity of 50 Bohemians

Maximum capacity of 25 Bohemians

Holders who have three Bohemians will be able to claim an entire public gallery for themselves. Holding three Bohemians will give the holder an alpha/premium role in the Discord, with access to private channels.

#### **PRIVATE GALLERIES**

It will be possible for Bohemians to lease a private gallery on a monthly basis by paying $WOOP.

The Bohemian who is leasing the gallery can invite others to join the gallery.

Private galleries have the option to ask visitors for an entrance fee in $WOOP.

If an entrance fee is applied, the gallery will not be listed in the Bohemian Ranking.

There is a maximum capacity of 50 NFTs that can be displayed.

#### **PARTNERSHIP GALLERIES**

Bohemia’s partner projects will have their dedicated galleries in Bohemia:

Only accessible for partner project holders

Banner and custom name integrated

There is a maximum capacity of 50 NFTs that can be displayed.

Bohemia can always add new partnership galleries should new partnerships be established.

#### **1/1 ARTIST GALLERIES**

Bohemia will be a platform for 1/1 artists and will dedicate several Bohemian Galleries to artists who want to showcase their art collections. Artists can reach out to us for this, and the proposal will be reviewed.

The artist will be able to showcase their collection during a one-month period.

This is free of charge and can be requested by holders and non-holders.

Bohemians can visit the artist’s exhibition.

#### **BOHEMIA DAO**

Holders of Bohemian NFTs will have access to the BohemiaDAO Discord. The Discord will house the GalleryDAOs, where gallery members can collaborate and discuss how they envision their exhibition. Bohemians can only access the GalleryDAO from the gallery in which they are staked, when staking in a new gallery, it will only be possible to access the GalleryDAO after 24 hours.

## **BOHEMIAN RANKING**

### **EXHIBITIONS**

The exhibition created by the gallery will be voted on by Bohemians. The number of votes an exhibit receives will determine the gallery ranking. The amount of $WOOP that gallery members receive for their exhibit depends on the Bohemian Ranking.

### **VOTING & RANKING**

Each Bohemian, regardless of whether they are staked in HQ or a gallery, will receive 30 votes per month, which can be given to favorite exhibits. Bohemians can only use one vote per gallery exhibition, so it is not possible to use multiple votes for the same exhibit. There will be a separate section on the website that facilitates the voting process.

When a holder uses all 30 of its votes, it will earn a reward in $WOOP. In this manner, we encourage Bohemians to vote so that the Gallery Ranking is based on a significant number of voting Bohemians.
